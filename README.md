Requirements:
This script was originally developed for qb-core. However, you can easily adapt it to other frameworks by making some simple changes to the qb-core import and draw text event. Additionally, you can customize the inventory open event, but the script is compatible with many inventory systems. PolyZone is a required dependency for this resource.
